# DateGuarantee

Welcome to the DateGuarantee project! This web-based application helps users make confident choices by presenting a simple yes/no question. When users click the "No" button, it moves away, leaving only the "Yes" button to click.

## Features

- Interactive interface with a yes/no choice
- Dynamic movement of the "No" button when clicked
- Customizable background video

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a basic web server set up to serve the HTML files.

## Note
Please remember to add a bg.mp4 to have a custom background.
